## Phase 8: Post-Acceptance Deliverables

**Goal**: Maximize the impact of your accepted paper through presentation materials and community engagement.

### Step 8.1: Conference Poster

Most conferences require a poster session. Poster design principles:

| Element | Guideline |
|---------|-----------|
| **Size** | Check venue requirements (typically 24"x36" or A0 portrait/landscape) |
| **Content** | Title, authors, 1-sentence contribution, method figure, 2-3 key results, conclusion |
| **Flow** | Top-left to bottom-right (Z-pattern) or columnar |
| **Text** | Title readable at 3m, body at 1m. No full paragraphs — bullet points only. |
| **Figures** | Reuse paper figures at higher resolution. Enlarge key result. |

**Tools**: LaTeX (`beamerposter` package), PowerPoint/Keynote, Figma, Canva.

**Production**: Order 2+ weeks before the conference. Fabric posters are lighter for travel. Many conferences now support virtual/digital posters too.

### Step 8.2: Conference Talk / Spotlight

If awarded an oral or spotlight presentation:

| Talk Type | Duration | Content |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Spotlight** | 5 min | Problem, approach, one key result. Rehearse to exactly 5 minutes. |
| **Oral** | 15-20 min | Full story: problem, approach, key results, ablations, limitations. |
| **Workshop talk** | 10-15 min | Adapt based on workshop audience — may need more background. |

**Slide design rules:**
- One idea per slide
- Minimize text — speak the details, don't project them
- Animate key figures to build understanding step-by-step
- Include a "takeaway" slide at the end (single sentence contribution)
- Prepare backup slides for anticipated questions

### Step 8.3: Blog Post / Social Media

An accessible summary significantly increases impact:

- **Twitter/X thread**: 5-8 tweets. Lead with the result, not the method. Include Figure 1 and key result figure.
- **Blog post**: 800-1500 words. Written for ML practitioners, not reviewers. Skip formalism, emphasize intuition and practical implications.
- **Project page**: HTML page with abstract, figures, demo, code link, BibTeX. Use GitHub Pages.

**Timing**: Post within 1-2 days of paper appearing on proceedings or arXiv camera-ready.

## Workshop & Short Papers

Workshop papers and short papers (e.g., ACL short papers, Findings papers) follow the same pipeline but with different constraints and expectations.

### Workshop Papers

| Property | Workshop | Main Conference |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Page limit** | 4-6 pages (typically) | 7-9 pages |
| **Review standard** | Lower bar for completeness | Must be complete, thorough |
| **Review process** | Usually single-blind or light review | Double-blind, rigorous |
| **What's valued** | Interesting ideas, preliminary results, position pieces | Complete empirical story with strong baselines |
| **arXiv** | Post anytime | Timing matters (see arXiv strategy) |
| **Contribution bar** | Novel direction, interesting negative result, work-in-progress | Significant advance with strong evidence |

**When to target a workshop:**
- Early-stage idea you want feedback on before a full paper
- Negative result that doesn't justify 8+ pages
- Position piece or opinion on a timely topic
- Replication study or reproducibility report

### ACL Short Papers & Findings

ACL venues have distinct submission types:

| Type | Pages | What's Expected |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| **Long paper** | 8 | Complete study, strong baselines, ablations |
| **Short paper** | 4 | Focused contribution: one clear point with evidence |
| **Findings** | 8 | Solid work that narrowly missed main conference |

**Short paper strategy**: Pick ONE claim and support it thoroughly. Don't try to compress a long paper into 4 pages — write a different, more focused paper.

## Paper Types Beyond Empirical ML

The main pipeline above targets empirical ML papers. Other paper types require different structures and evidence standards. See [references/paper-types.md](references/paper-types.md) for detailed guidance on each type.

### Theory Papers

**Structure**: Introduction → Preliminaries (definitions, notation) → Main Results (theorems) → Proof Sketches → Discussion → Full Proofs (appendix)

**Key differences from empirical papers:**
- Contribution is a theorem, bound, or impossibility result — not experimental numbers
- Methods section replaced by "Preliminaries" and "Main Results"
- Proofs are the evidence, not experiments (though empirical validation of theory is welcome)
- Proof sketches in main text, full proofs in appendix is standard practice
- Experimental section is optional but strengthens the paper if it validates theoretical predictions

**Proof writing principles:**
- State theorems formally with all assumptions explicit
- Provide intuition before formal proof ("The key insight is...")
- Proof sketches should convey the main idea in 0.5-1 page
- Use `\begin{proof}...\end{proof}` environments
- Number assumptions and reference them in theorems: "Under Assumptions 1-3, ..."

### Survey / Tutorial Papers

**Structure**: Introduction → Taxonomy / Organization → Detailed Coverage → Open Problems → Conclusion

**Key differences:**
- Contribution is the organization, synthesis, and identification of open problems — not new methods
- Must be comprehensive within scope (reviewers will check for missing references)
- Requires a clear taxonomy or organizational framework
- Value comes from connections between works that individual papers don't make
- Best venues: TMLR (survey track), JMLR, Foundations and Trends in ML, ACM Computing Surveys

### Benchmark Papers

**Structure**: Introduction → Task Definition → Dataset Construction → Baseline Evaluation → Analysis → Intended Use & Limitations

**Key differences:**
- Contribution is the benchmark itself — it must fill a genuine evaluation gap
- Dataset documentation is mandatory, not optional (see Datasheets, Step 5.11)
- Must demonstrate the benchmark is challenging (baselines don't saturate it)
- Must demonstrate the benchmark measures what you claim it measures (construct validity)
- Best venues: NeurIPS Datasets & Benchmarks track, ACL (resource papers), LREC-COLING

### Position Papers

**Structure**: Introduction → Background → Thesis / Argument → Supporting Evidence → Counterarguments → Implications

**Key differences:**
- Contribution is an argument, not a result
- Must engage seriously with counterarguments
- Evidence can be empirical, theoretical, or logical analysis
- Best venues: ICML (position track), workshops, TMLR

## Hermes Agent Integration

This skill is designed for the Hermes agent. It uses Hermes tools, delegation, scheduling, and memory for the full research lifecycle.

### Related Skills

Compose this skill with other Hermes skills for specific phases:

| Skill | When to Use | How to Load |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **arxiv** | Phase 1 (Literature Review): searching arXiv, generating BibTeX, finding related papers via Semantic Scholar | `skill_view("arxiv")` |
| **subagent-driven-development** | Phase 5 (Drafting): parallel section writing with 2-stage review (spec compliance then quality) | `skill_view("subagent-driven-development")` |
| **plan** | Phase 0 (Setup): creating structured plans before execution. Writes to `.hermes/plans/` | `skill_view("plan")` |
| **qmd** | Phase 1 (Literature): searching local knowledge bases (notes, transcripts, docs) via hybrid BM25+vector search | Install: `skill_manage("install", "qmd")` |
| **diagramming** | Phase 4-5: creating Excalidraw-based figures and architecture diagrams | `skill_view("diagramming")` |
| **data-science** | Phase 4 (Analysis): Jupyter live kernel for interactive analysis and visualization | `skill_view("data-science")` |

**This skill supersedes `ml-paper-writing`** — it contains all of ml-paper-writing's content plus the full experiment/analysis pipeline and autoreason methodology.

### Hermes Tools Reference

| Tool | Usage in This Pipeline |
|------|----------------------|
| **`terminal`** | LaTeX compilation (`latexmk -pdf`), git operations, launching experiments (`nohup python run.py &`), process checks |
| **`process`** | Background experiment management: `process("start", ...)`, `process("poll", pid)`, `process("log", pid)`, `process("kill", pid)` |
| **`execute_code`** | Run Python for citation verification, statistical analysis, data aggregation. Has tool access via RPC. |
| **`read_file`** / **`write_file`** / **`patch`** | Paper editing, experiment scripts, result files. Use `patch` for targeted edits to large .tex files. |
| **`web_search`** | Literature discovery: `web_search("transformer attention mechanism 2024")` |
| **`web_extract`** | Fetch paper content, verify citations: `web_extract("https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17651")` |
| **`delegate_task`** | **Parallel section drafting** — spawn isolated subagents for each section. Also for concurrent citation verification. |
| **`todo`** | Primary state tracker across sessions. Update after every phase transition. |
| **`memory`** | Persist key decisions across sessions: contribution framing, venue choice, reviewer feedback. |
| **`cronjob`** | Schedule experiment monitoring, deadline countdowns, automated arXiv checks. |
| **`clarify`** | Ask the user targeted questions when blocked (venue choice, contribution framing). |
| **`send_message`** | Notify user when experiments complete or drafts are ready, even if user isn't in chat. |

### Tool Usage Patterns

**Experiment monitoring** (most common):
```
terminal("ps aux | grep <pattern>")
→ terminal("tail -30 <logfile>")
→ terminal("ls results/")
→ execute_code("analyze results JSON, compute metrics")
→ terminal("git add -A && git commit -m '<descriptive message>' && git push")
→ send_message("Experiment complete: <summary>")
```

**Parallel section drafting** (using delegation):
```
delegate_task("Draft the Methods section based on these experiment scripts and configs. 
  Include: pseudocode, all hyperparameters, architectural details sufficient for 
  reproduction. Write in LaTeX using the neurips2025 template conventions.")

delegate_task("Draft the Related Work section. Use web_search and web_extract to 
  find papers. Verify every citation via Semantic Scholar. Group by methodology.")

delegate_task("Draft the Experiments section. Read all result files in results/. 
  State which claim each experiment supports. Include error bars and significance.")
```

Each delegate runs as a **fresh subagent** with no shared context — provide all necessary information in the prompt. Collect outputs and integrate.

**Citation verification** (using execute_code):
```python
# In execute_code:
from semanticscholar import SemanticScholar
import requests

sch = SemanticScholar()
results = sch.search_paper("attention mechanism transformers", limit=5)
for paper in results:
    doi = paper.externalIds.get('DOI', 'N/A')
    if doi != 'N/A':
        bibtex = requests.get(f"https://doi.org/{doi}", 
                              headers={"Accept": "application/x-bibtex"}).text
        print(bibtex)
```

### State Management with `memory` and `todo`

**`memory` tool** — persist key decisions (bounded: ~2200 chars for MEMORY.md):

```
memory("add", "Paper: autoreason. Venue: NeurIPS 2025 (9 pages). 
  Contribution: structured refinement works when generation-evaluation gap is wide.
  Key results: Haiku 42/42, Sonnet 3/5, S4.6 constrained 2/3.
  Status: Phase 5 — drafting Methods section.")
```

Update memory after major decisions or phase transitions. This persists across sessions.

**`todo` tool** — track granular progress:

```
todo("add", "Design constrained task experiments for Sonnet 4.6")
todo("add", "Run Haiku baseline comparison")
todo("add", "Draft Methods section")
todo("update", id=3, status="in_progress")
todo("update", id=1, status="completed")
```

**Session startup protocol:**
```
1. todo("list")                           # Check current task list
2. memory("read")                         # Recall key decisions
3. terminal("git log --oneline -10")      # Check recent commits
4. terminal("ps aux | grep python")       # Check running experiments
5. terminal("ls results/ | tail -20")     # Check for new results
6. Report status to user, ask for direction
```

### Cron Monitoring with `cronjob`

Use the `cronjob` tool to schedule periodic experiment checks:

```
cronjob("create", {
  "schedule": "*/30 * * * *",  # Every 30 minutes
  "prompt": "Check experiment status:
    1. ps aux | grep run_experiment
    2. tail -30 logs/experiment_haiku.log
    3. ls results/haiku_baselines/
    4. If complete: read results, compute Borda scores, 
       git add -A && git commit -m 'Add Haiku results' && git push
    5. Report: table of results, key finding, next step
    6. If nothing changed: respond with [SILENT]"
})
```

**[SILENT] protocol**: When nothing has changed since the last check, respond with exactly `[SILENT]`. This suppresses notification delivery to the user. Only report when there are genuine changes worth knowing about.

**Deadline tracking**:
```
cronjob("create", {
  "schedule": "0 9 * * *",  # Daily at 9am
  "prompt": "NeurIPS 2025 deadline: May 22. Today is {date}. 
    Days remaining: {compute}. 
    Check todo list — are we on track? 
    If <7 days: warn user about remaining tasks."
})
```

### Communication Patterns

**When to notify the user** (via `send_message` or direct response):
- Experiment batch completed (with results table)
- Unexpected finding or failure requiring decision
- Draft section ready for review
- Deadline approaching with incomplete tasks

**When NOT to notify:**
- Experiment still running, no new results → `[SILENT]`
- Routine monitoring with no changes → `[SILENT]`
- Intermediate steps that don't need attention

**Report format** — always include structured data:
```
## Experiment: <name>
Status: Complete / Running / Failed

| Task | Method A | Method B | Method C |
|------|---------|---------|---------|
| Task 1 | 85.2 | 82.1 | **89.4** |

Key finding: <one sentence>
Next step: <what happens next>
```

### Decision Points Requiring Human Input

Use `clarify` for targeted questions when genuinely blocked:

| Decision | When to Ask |
|----------|-------------|
| Target venue | Before starting paper (affects page limits, framing) |
| Contribution framing | When multiple valid framings exist |
| Experiment priority | When TODO list has more experiments than time allows |
| Submission readiness | Before final submission |

**Do NOT ask about** (be proactive, make a choice, flag it):
- Word choice, section ordering
- Which specific results to highlight
- Citation completeness (draft with what you find, note gaps)

## Reviewer Evaluation Criteria

Understanding what reviewers look for helps focus effort:

| Criterion | What They Check |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Quality** | Technical soundness, well-supported claims, fair baselines |
| **Clarity** | Clear writing, reproducible by experts, consistent notation |
| **Significance** | Community impact, advances understanding |
| **Originality** | New insights (doesn't require new method) |

**Scoring (NeurIPS 6-point scale):**
- 6: Strong Accept — groundbreaking, flawless
- 5: Accept — technically solid, high impact
- 4: Borderline Accept — solid, limited evaluation
- 3: Borderline Reject — weaknesses outweigh
- 2: Reject — technical flaws
- 1: Strong Reject — known results or ethics issues

See [references/reviewer-guidelines.md](references/reviewer-guidelines.md) for detailed guidelines, common concerns, and rebuttal strategies.

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Abstract too generic | Delete first sentence if it could prepend any ML paper. Start with your specific contribution. |
| Introduction exceeds 1.5 pages | Split background into Related Work. Front-load contribution bullets. |
| Experiments lack explicit claims | Add: "This experiment tests whether [specific claim]..." before each one. |
| Reviewers find paper hard to follow | Add signposting, use consistent terminology, make figure captions self-contained. |
| Missing statistical significance | Add error bars, number of runs, statistical tests, confidence intervals. |
| Scope creep in experiments | Every experiment must map to a specific claim. Cut experiments that don't. |
| Paper rejected, need to resubmit | See Conference Resubmission in Phase 7. Address reviewer concerns without referencing reviews. |
| Missing broader impact statement | See Step 5.10. Most venues require it. "No negative impacts" is almost never credible. |
| Human eval criticized as weak | See Step 2.5 and [references/human-evaluation.md](references/human-evaluation.md). Report agreement metrics, annotator details, compensation. |
| Reviewers question reproducibility | Release code (Step 7.9), document all hyperparameters, include seeds and compute details. |
| Theory paper lacks intuition | Add proof sketches with plain-language explanations before formal proofs. See [references/paper-types.md](references/paper-types.md). |
| Results are negative/null | See Phase 4.3 on handling negative results. Consider workshops, TMLR, or reframing as analysis. |
