# Phase 2: Experiment Design

**Part of:** [Research Paper Writing Pipeline](../SKILL.md)

**Goal**: Design experiments with explicit claim mapping. Every experiment connects to paper claims.

## Phase 2: Experiment Design

**Goal**: Design experiments that directly support paper claims. Every experiment must answer a specific question.

### Step 2.1: Map Claims to Experiments

Create an explicit mapping:

| Claim | Experiment | Expected Evidence |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| "Our method outperforms baselines" | Main comparison (Table 1) | Win rate, statistical significance |
| "Effect is larger for weaker models" | Model scaling study | Monotonic improvement curve |
| "Convergence requires scope constraints" | Constrained vs unconstrained | Convergence rate comparison |

**Rule**: If an experiment doesn't map to a claim, don't run it.

### Step 2.2: Design Baselines

Strong baselines are what separates accepted papers from rejected ones. Reviewers will ask: "Did they compare against X?"

Standard baseline categories:
- **Naive baseline**: Simplest possible approach
- **Strong baseline**: Best known existing method
- **Ablation baselines**: Your method minus one component
- **Compute-matched baselines**: Same compute budget, different allocation

### Step 2.3: Define Evaluation Protocol

Before running anything, specify:
- **Metrics**: What you're measuring, direction symbols (higher/lower better)
- **Aggregation**: How results are combined across runs/tasks
- **Statistical tests**: What tests will establish significance
- **Sample sizes**: How many runs/problems/tasks

### Step 2.4: Write Experiment Scripts

Follow these patterns from successful research pipelines:

**Incremental saving** — save results after each step for crash recovery:
```python
# Save after each problem/task
result_path = f"results/{task}/{strategy}/result.json"
if os.path.exists(result_path):
    continue  # Skip already-completed work
# ... run experiment ...
with open(result_path, 'w') as f:
    json.dump(result, f, indent=2)
```

**Artifact preservation** — save all intermediate outputs:
```
results/<experiment>/
  <task>/
    <strategy>/
      final_output.md          # Final result
      history.json             # Full trajectory
      pass_01/                 # Per-iteration artifacts
        version_a.md
        version_b.md
        critic.md
```

**Separation of concerns** — keep generation, evaluation, and visualization separate:
```
run_experiment.py              # Core experiment runner
run_baselines.py               # Baseline comparison
run_comparison_judge.py        # Blind evaluation
analyze_results.py             # Statistical analysis
make_charts.py                 # Visualization
```

See [references/experiment-patterns.md](references/experiment-patterns.md) for complete design patterns, cron monitoring, and error recovery.

### Step 2.5: Design Human Evaluation (If Applicable)

Many NLP, HCI, and alignment papers require human evaluation as primary or complementary evidence. Design this before running automated experiments — human eval often has longer lead times (IRB approval, annotator recruitment).

**When human evaluation is needed:**
- Automated metrics don't capture what you care about (fluency, helpfulness, safety)
- Your contribution is about human-facing qualities (readability, preference, trust)
- Reviewers at NLP venues (ACL, EMNLP) expect it for generation tasks

**Key design decisions:**

| Decision | Options | Guidance |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Annotator type** | Expert, crowdworker, end-user | Match to what your claims require |
| **Scale** | Likert (1-5), pairwise comparison, ranking | Pairwise is more reliable than Likert for LLM outputs |
| **Sample size** | Per annotator and total items | Power analysis or minimum 100 items, 3+ annotators |
| **Agreement metric** | Cohen's kappa, Krippendorff's alpha, ICC | Krippendorff's alpha for >2 annotators; report raw agreement too |
| **Platform** | Prolific, MTurk, internal team | Prolific for quality; MTurk for scale; internal for domain expertise |

**Annotation guideline checklist:**
```
- [ ] Clear task description with examples (good AND bad)
- [ ] Decision criteria for ambiguous cases
- [ ] At least 2 worked examples per category
- [ ] Attention checks / gold standard items (10-15% of total)
- [ ] Qualification task or screening round
- [ ] Estimated time per item and fair compensation (>= local minimum wage)
- [ ] IRB/ethics review if required by your institution
```

**Reporting requirements** (reviewers check all of these):
- Number of annotators and their qualifications
- Inter-annotator agreement with specific metric and value
- Compensation details (amount, estimated hourly rate)
- Annotation interface description or screenshot (appendix)
- Total annotation time

See [references/human-evaluation.md](references/human-evaluation.md) for complete guide including statistical tests for human eval data, crowdsourcing quality control patterns, and IRB guidance.
